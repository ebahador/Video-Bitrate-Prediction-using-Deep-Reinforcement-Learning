`The research contains four different parts:`

1.   Data Preprocessing
2.   Supervised Learning and LSTM
3.   Overal Results
4.   Adaptive Bitrate Streaming with Q-Learning
This project uses machine learning models like LSTM, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost to predict video quality and optimize streaming. It includes a bitrate ladder and focuses on improving the Quality of Experience (QoE) while using lower bitrates.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erikvdven/tiktok-trending-december-2020/

The project uses a dataset of 600 1080p videos encoded at various resolutions and bitrates.

FYI: For more details of implementation, refer to comments within the code. This project is intended for the final project of COMP 691, focusing on video streaming quality.
